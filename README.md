# Windows Taskkill
A simple Windows 10 program through which you can kill any process running on your pc in an instant\
\
NOTE: This is my first ever project and also my first time practically programming. I am very aware that a program to kill processes is not a very useful tool and can also cause problems. However, I still decided to do it, because I thought it would be a very nice project to start off with. \
# Dependencies
Coming soon.
